            "paragraph2": "You are probably wondering, how I switched from the YouTube world to development, well, <highlight>I am a non-conformist person, I always want to learn or make new things,</highlight> that's why I wished to make my own website to my channel to publish my own content, have control of it and better yet, add my YouTube videos automatically.",
            "paragraph3": "Although that was my initial idea, I didn't know how to start doing it, so I began to look for videos on YouTube of \"how to create your own website\" and, finally I found a website that created other websites called <link>Wix</link>. I was very excited because I was creating something of my own with my own hands, It was basically like<highlight>\"my own little personal brand\".</highlight> As time went on, I felt the need to add more and more things, to the point where Wix wouldn't let me do what I wanted to do and I couldn't find videos to help me with that either.",
            "paragraph4": "So, I kept searching on the Internet how to do what I wanted, I realized that it was possible to do it but with code and, unfortunately, Wix didn't give me the freedom to use code on its site. However, <highlight>I never gave up</highlight> and started looking for a solution, this solution was to make the page again with HTML and CSS. Once I got the same visual result as my Wix page, I tried to use the code I previously found by following what people were saying on the internet.",

Also, I participated in a <highlight>E-learning</highlight> project.",
            "paragraph2": "After 1 year I had to leave my country to go to Argentina where I had the chance to work with Angular 5 in a <highlight>call center</highlight> project. After two years, I changed the project for another one related to customer service through chat that was developed with <linkReact>React</linkReact> in the Frontend. In that occasion one of the things I learned was the <linkMicroFrontend>micro frontends</linkMicroFrontend> concept, thanks to that architecture we could <highlight>embed the chat inside another monolithic application built in AngularJS.</highlight> We were also able to do this within the mobile applications with native code, this time using <linkWebView>Web Views.</linkWebView>",
            "paragraph3": "What I liked the most about this was <highlight>how to make several applications live together in a single application</highlight>, regardless of the technologies in which they were made, be in a team completely separated to the monolithic team and achieve independence with the development and deployment of new features.",
            "paragraph4": "Simultaneously to my work, I am working on my own blog which is built with <linkSvelte>Svelte</linkSvelte> (you probably saw it in my <linkProjects>featured projects</linkProjects>) and although at the time of writing this, the backend is not connected to it, I am using <linkNestJs>NestJS</linkNestJs> to make the sessions so that people can create their own content directly on my blog.",
            "paragraph5": "I have also been working as a freelancer at <linkWorkana>Workana</linkWorkana> for quite a long time, since I started, I have always been in the mobile area, this time using <linkIonic>Ionic 3</linkIonic> and <linkReactNative>React Native</linkReactNative> to develop the applications.",
